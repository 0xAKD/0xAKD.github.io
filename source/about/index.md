## About Me 
I'm Ajay, a technology enthusiast with a growing interest in software development, systems, and modern web technologies. With a strong focus on continuous learning, I use this platform to document my technical journey, share insights, and explore practical solutions to real-world problems.

My approach is grounded in clarity and curiosity — whether it's understanding core programming concepts or experimenting with new tools and frameworks. This site serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others on a similar path.

I’m currently building foundational skills in programming and development, and I aim to contribute to meaningful projects while growing as a developer.
